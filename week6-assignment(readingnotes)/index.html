        <h1>Programming Design Systems</h1>
        <p>
            1. We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper, and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design for digital devices.

            2. Digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions.

            Re: It reminds me of the transition from pure text writing to hypertext.

           3. However, there is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.

        <h1>What do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>

        <p>
            1. Industrial designers call a molded foam model a prototype. Interaction designers refer to simulation of on-screen appearance and behavior as a prototype. Programmers call a test program a prototype.
        </p>

            Re: When I first started taking the course, I was always confused by what different people said about prototypes.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. Is a brick a prototype? The answer depends on how it is used. If it is used to represent the weight and scale of some future artifact, then it certainly is: it prototypes the weight and scale of the artifact.

           3.  A rough hand-drawn prototype would not have made the idea seem real to the broad audience the video addressed: high resolution was necessary to help people concretely visualize the design.
